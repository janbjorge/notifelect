# **Notifelect: Robust Leader Election for Distributed Systems Using PostgreSQL NOTIFY**

Notifelect is a Python package designed for seamless leader election in distributed systems. It utilizes the NOTIFY feature of PostgreSQL to manage elections, offering a robust and reliable solution for systems requiring fault tolerance and consistency across nodes. Leveraging the Bully algorithm, Notifelect ensures dynamic leader selection with minimal configuration.

**Why Notifelect?**
- **Efficient Leader Elections**: Utilizes PostgreSQL's NOTIFY and sequences for efficient and accurate leader determination.
- **Asynchronous Operations**: Built with asyncio, allowing for non-blocking, event-driven communication.
- **Easy to Integrate**: Simple API that fits naturally into existing Python applications.

Enhance your distributed systems with Notifelectâ€™s efficient leader election mechanism for improved reliability and performance.

## Getting Started
Installation is straightforward using pip:

```bash
pip install notifelect
python -m notifelect install  # Set up necessary database sequences
```

## Quick Example
Simulate a leader election among N processes:

```python
import asyncio
import contextlib
import random
import sys
from typing import AsyncGenerator

import asyncpg
from notifelect import election_manager

@contextlib.asynccontextmanager
async def connection() -> AsyncGenerator[asyncpg.Connection, None]:
    conn = await asyncpg.connect()
    try:
        yield conn
    finally:
        await conn.close()

async def process() -> None:
    await asyncio.sleep(random.random() * 2)
    async with connection() as conn, election_manager.Coordinator(conn):
        await asyncio.sleep(float('inf'))

async def main() -> None:
    N = int(sys.argv[1])
    processes = [process() for _ in range(N)]
    await asyncio.gather(*processes)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

### Enhancements
- **Clear Value Proposition**: Begins with why Notifelect is beneficial and its specific features.
- **Streamlined Setup and Example**: Simplified instructions and example for easier comprehension and quicker start.
- **Engaging Introduction**: More direct and impactful opening to grab attention immediately.
