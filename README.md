# **notifelect: A Distributed Leader Election Python Package Using PostgreSQL NOTIFY**

notifelect is an Python package designed to facilitate leader election in distributed systems. Utilizing PostgreSQL's powerful NOTIFY feature, notifelect orchestrates the election process through efficient communication channels, ensuring robust process synchronization. Built on the principles of the Bully algorithm, this package helps systems dynamically elect leaders based on process IDs managed via PostgreSQL sequences. Ideal for systems requiring high reliability and consistency across nodes, notifelect integrates seamlessly into existing Python applications leveraging asynchronous programming.

Key Features:
- **Leader Election**: Implements the Bully election algorithm using PostgreSQL for process ID generation and leader election logic.
- **Asynchronous Communication**: Leverages PostgreSQL NOTIFY for real-time, event-driven communication between nodes.
- **High Scalability**: Optimized for performance in large distributed systems.
- **Easy Integration**: Designed with a straightforward API to plug into existing projects.
